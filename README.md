#### Aim
To develop an application which collates all the food options in NUS (Currently limited to UTown due to Covid'19).
This will allow us to make a more informed decision on our food choices. 
The application will be very useful for incoming freshmen who wish to explore the campus and discover their favourite stores without much hassle.

#### Possible Extensions
- Allow the sharing of restaurants and food choice between users within the app
- Personalise daily recommendations based on the usersâ€™ dining history and search history using Machine Learning 
- Advertisements to promote stalls and restaurants


#### Product
- iOS App
- Android App

#### Tech Stack
- ReactNative for app development
- Metro for ReactNative
- JavaScript, JSX, Python
- FireBase for backend database and authentication
